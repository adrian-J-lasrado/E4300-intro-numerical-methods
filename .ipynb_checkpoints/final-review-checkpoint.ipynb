    "Guidelines:\n",
    "1. Use resources available to you from class and online.\n",
    "1. That being said this is an individual effort, do not work with others and cite what you do use.\n",
    "1. Copying is prohibited, write your own code and solutions (you can copy from the notes).\n",
    "1. Do not use piazza for the duration of the exam, it will be frozen!  \n",
    "1. If you have a question please email the instructor and the TAs for maximal response possibilities.  We will answer questions that pertain only to clarification.  In particular this means we will not debug your code.\n",
    "1. Late turn in of the final will result in a 10% reduction every HOUR that it is late.  If you feel that there is a special circumstance that warrants consideration tells us BEFORE Tuesday (and more so before the exam starts).\n",
